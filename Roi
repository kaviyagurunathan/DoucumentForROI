Title: Invoicing ROI Simulator

Problem: Provide a fast ROI simulator that shows cost savings, payback, and biased favorable ROI for switching from manual to automated invoicing.

Proposed solution: Single-page React app + Node/Express API + SQLite for scenario persistence. /simulate performs server-side calculations (internal constants are server-only). UI supports quick inputs, live simulation, save/load/delete scenarios, and email-gated report generation.

Key features: quick simulation, CRUD scenarios, downloadable email-gated PDF/HTML report, REST APIand backend bias factor to ensure positive ROI.

Tech stack & infra: React frontend, Node + Express backend, for database i use Mysql(file) for persistence, pdfkit/html2pdf for report; deploy frontend on netlify, backend on Render.

3 hours :

 * Submit this doc and create repo.

* Build simulate endpoint + calculations.

* Build frontend form + live results + scenario CRUD.

* Add email-gated report, deploy, test, write README, submit Form 2.

* Inputs validated & persisted, outputs biased in favor of automation, email-gated report works.
